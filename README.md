## Features

- **Bug Hopping**: The bug appears at random positions on the canvas at intervals.
- **Click to Catch**: Click on the bug to "smash" it and increase your score.
- **Speed Increase**: The bug moves faster each time it's clicked, increasing the difficulty of the game.
- **Reset Buttons**: 
  - Reset the bug's speed to its initial slow speed.
  - Reset the score to 0 and restart the game.

## How to Play

1. Click on the bug as it hops around the canvas to increase your score.
2. As you catch the bug, it speeds up, making it harder to catch next time.
3. Use the **Reset Speed** button to slow the bug back to its original speed.
4. Use the **Reset Score** button to restart the game and reset the score to 0.

## Technologies Used
